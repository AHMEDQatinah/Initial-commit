      <h2>Canada</h2>
      <p><h3>
        The Vintage Car Club of Canada (VCCC) recognizes vehicles that are 25
        years old and older. The VCCC is one of the oldest collector car clubs
        in Canada. It has been a registered Society since the mid 1950s. Each
        year a different Chapter hosts the annual May Tour in a different
        geographical location in British Columbia. The VCCC has approximately
        2800 members in BC counting spouses. The club has been a continuous
        member of the (NAACC) National Association of Automobile Clubs of Canada
        Corporation since 1971. The National Association of Automobile Clubs of
        Canada (NAACC) recognizes stock and modified vehicles that are 20 years
        old and older. The National Association of Automobile Clubs of Canada is
        Federally incorporated as a 'not for profit' Corporation. Operational
        since 1970 it is one of the largest collector vehicle Associations in
        North America. The NAACC is responsible for doing away with 'Duty' at
        the Canadian border. All vehicles and related parts that are 25 years
        old or older are 'Duty' free when entered into Canada. As of this
        writing the NAACC is represented in every Province in Canada. The
        Association sanctions two major Concours in Canada. The Cobble Beach
        Concours in Kemble Ontario (Owen Sound) and the Crescent Beach Concours
        on the west coast (Surrey BC) are sanctioned by the NAACC.

      <h2>United States</h2>
      <p><h3>
        Cars produced in 1915 and older typically fall into the antique class
        and this includes the "Brass Era car" that are defined by the Horseless
        Carriage Club of America (HCCA) as "any pioneer gas, steam and electric
        motor vehicle built or manufactured prior to January 1, 1916." The
        "classic" term is often applied loosely by owners to any car that is
        more than 20 years old.Legally, most states have time-based rules for
        the definition of "historic" or "classic" for purposes such as antique
        vehicle registration. For example, Maryland defines historic vehicles as
        20 calendar years old or older and they "must not have been
        substantially altered, remodeled or remanufactured from the
        manufacturers original design" while West Virginia defines motor
        vehicles manufactured at least 25 years prior to the current year as
        eligible for "classic" car license plates. Despite this, at many
        American classic car shows, automobiles typically range from the 1920s
        to the 1970s. Recently, many 1980s and even early 1990s cars are
        considered being "classic automobiles". Examples of cars at such shows
        include the Chevrolet Bel-Air, Ford Model T, Dodge Charger, Ford Deuce
        Coupe, and 1949 Ford. Meanwhile, the Concours d'Elegance car shows
        feature prestigious automobiles such as the Cadillac V16 or pre-1940
        Rolls-Royce models. There are also terms as "modern customs", "exotics",
        or "collectibles" that cover cars such as the AMC Gremlin or Ford Pinto.
        There are differences in the exact identification of a "classic car".
        Division by separate eras include: horseless carriages (19th-century
        experimental automobiles such as the Daimler Motor Carriage), antique
        cars (brass era cars such as the Model T), and classic cars (typically
        1930s cars such as the Cord 812). Some also include muscle cars, with
        the 1974 model year as the cutoff.

      <h2>Classic Car Club of America</h2>
      <p><h3>
        The Classic Car Club of America describes a CCCA Classic as a "fine" or
        "distinctive" automobile, either American or foreign built, produced
        between 1915 and 1948. The CCCA is dedicated to the preservation and
        enjoyment of select cars that "are distinguished by their respective
        fine design, high engineering standards and superior workmanship." Other
        differentiating factors - including engine displacement, custom
        coachwork, and luxury accessories such as power brakes, power clutch,
        and "one-shot" or automatic lubrication systems - help determine whether
        a car is considered a CCCA Classic. The cars on their list "represent
        the pinnacle of engineering, styling and design for their era." Any CCCA
        member may petition for a vehicle to join the list. Such applications
        are carefully scrutinized, but rarely is a new vehicle type admitted.
        Moreover, no commercial vehicles such as hearses, ambulances, or race
        cars are accepted as a Full Classic. The CCCA maintains this definition
        of "classic car" and uses terms such as CCCA Classic or the trademarked
        Full Classic. The CCCA has estimated that 1,366,843 "American Classics"
        were built. Antique Automobile Club of America The Antique Automobile
        Club of America (AACA) recognizes "motorized vehicles 25 years old or
        older, which were built in factories and specifically designed and
        manufactured for transportation use on public roadways and highways."
        Judging by the AACA evaluates such vehicles to be in historic or that
        have "been restored to the same state as the dealer could have prepared
        the vehicle for delivery to the customer." Specified AACA classic
        vehicles include "fine or unusual domestic or foreign automobiles
        primarily built between and including the years 1925 and 1942."

      <h2>Renting Classic Cars in the US</h2>
      <p><h3>
        For those in the United States who do not own a classic car but still
        wish to get behind the wheel, few companies in the United States allow
        people to rent from their personal collection of classic cars. Monterey
        Touring Vehicles has over 30 classic cars that people can rent. On the
        East Coast, people in North Carolina can rent for special occasions in
        Raleigh from Carolina Classic Car Rentals.
      </h3></p>
      <br />
      <h2>United Kingdom</h2>
      <p><h3>
        There is no fixed definition of a classic car. Two taxation issues do
        impact however, leading to some people using them as cutoff dates. All
        cars built over 40 years ago are exempted from paying the annual road
        tax vehicle excise duty, and also exempt from the annual UK safety test
        known as the MOT test, however the vehicle can still be presented for
        test on a voluntary basis. HM Revenue and Customs define a classic car
        for company taxation purposes as being over 15 years old and having a
        value in excess of Â£15,000. Additionally, popular acclaim through
        classic car magazines can play an important role in whether a car comes
        to be regarded as a classic but the definition remains subjective and a
        matter of opinion. The elimination of depreciation can be a reason for
        buying a classic car and picking 'future classics' that are current
        'bangers' can result in a profit for the buyer as well as providing
        transport. An immaculate well cared for prestige model with high running
        costs that impacts its value, but is not yet old enough to be regarded
        as a classic, could be a good buy, for example.
      </h3></p>
      <br />
      <h2>Modern classics</h2>
      <p><h3>
        Modern classic cars are generally older vehicles, ranging from 15 to 25
        years, but are usually not accepted as classics according to the Antique
        Automobile Club of America. In the United Kingdom, the modern classic
        definition is open to the discretion often by Insurance Brokers and
        Insurance Companies who regard a Modern Classic as a vehicle that is
        considered collectible regardless of age. The usage of the vehicle
        limited to recreational purposes or restricted mileage is also taken
        into account.
      </h3></p>
      <br />
      <h2>Classic car styling</h2>
      <p><h3>
        There was a worldwide change in styling trends in the immediate years
        after the end of World War II. The 1946 Crosley and Kaiser-Frazer, for
        example, changed the traditional discrete replaceable-fender treatment.
        From this point on, automobiles of all kinds became envelope bodies in
        basic plan. The CCCA term, "antique car" has been confined to "the
        functionally traditional designs of the earlier period" (mostly
        pre-war). They tended to have removable fenders, trunk, headlights, and
        a usual vertical grill treatment. In a large vehicle, such as a
        Duesenberg, Pierce-Arrow, or in a smaller form, the MG TC, with
        traditional lines, might typify the CCCA term. Another vehicle might be
        a classic example of a later period but not a car from the "classic
        period of design", in the opinion of the CCCA.
      </h3></p>
      <br />
      <h2>Fraud</h2>
      <p><h3>
        Classic cars are subject to various types of fraud, most notably
        provenance fraud, where owners falsify documentation and serial numbers
        in order to make a car's history seem more colorful and historic. Fraud
        also assumes the form of knowingly inflating a car's estimated resale
        value, as was referenced in court proceedings relating to JD Classics,
        hitherto one of the UK's largest and best-known classic car dealers
        prior to its collapse in 2018.
      </h3></p>
      <br />
      <h2>Emission levels</h2>
      <p><h3>
        Classic cars are typically built to meet the national car emission
        levels that were present in the year of production of the vehicle. EU
        and US emission standards have increased in many countries since then.
        As a result, they may not be allowed to enter cities with special
        emission restrictions or low emission zones. Converting the car to run
        on a different fuel (i.e. SVO, LPG, CNG, hydrogen, ...) may decrease
        emission levels.
      </h3></p>
      <br />
      <h2>Safety</h2>
      <p><h3>
        Classic cars often lack what is now considered basic safety features,
        including seat belts, crumple zones or rollover protection. In September
        2009, ABC News' Good Morning America and World News showed a U.S.
        Insurance Institute of Highway Safety crash test of a 2009 Chevrolet
        Malibu in an offset head-on collision with a 1959 Chevrolet Bel Air
        sedan. It dramatically demonstrated the effectiveness of modern car
        safety design, over 1950s X-frame design, particularly of rigid
        passenger safety cells and crumple zones. The 1959 Chevrolets used an X
        frame design which lacked structural rigidity; had the IIHS used a
        pre-1958 Chevrolet with a perimeter frame design, the results would have
        been much better. Vehicle handling characteristics (particularly
        steering and suspension) and brake performance are likely to be poorer
        than current standards, hence requiring greater road-awareness on the
        part of the driver. In certain areas of the United States, using a
        classic car as a daily vehicle is strongly discouraged and may even be
        considered illegal in some places. The British AA motoring association
        has urged motorists using or driving near classic cars to pay particular
        attention to safety. The issue received particular public attention
        following a 2013 case in which a driver in a hire 1963 MGB was killed
        immediately in a collision with a taxi. Retro-styled (color-coded with
        chromed buckles) 2-point and 3-point seat (safety) belts are
        manufactured according to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards
        (FMVSS). However, most classic car bodies (manufactured before the late
        1960s) did not include safety belts as standard equipment, and do not
        include readily available reinforced mounting points, on the vehicle
        body, therefore it can be problematic to install such equipment
        properly: specific studies and calculations should be performed before
        any attempts. Proper installation is critical, which means locating
        attachment points on the body/frame, assuring the strength by proper
        reinforcement, and following the seat belt installation instructions
        properly to reduce the risk of malfunction or failure. Some classic car
        owners are reluctant to retrofit seat belts for the loss of originality
        this modification implies. There have also been instances of cars losing
        points at shows for being retrofitted with seat belts. Fitting modern
        tires is also a suggestion to improve the handling. However, most modern
        tires may be much wider and have a lower profile than those used on
        classic cars when new, therefore they may interfere with suspension
        elements and the tire walls may become damaged. The suspension of a
        classic car may not be suitable for radial ply tyres, having been
        designed to only accommodate bias ply tires. Narrow classic car wheels
        may have been designed for narrow high-profile tube tires and not be
        suitable for modern tubeless radial tires. Another problem with modern
        tires on classic cars is that increased grip requires increased steering
        effort; many classic cars do not come with power steering. Many major
        tire companies have dedicated classic car tire marketing departments and
        will be able to give expert technical advice to address all these
        issues. It is important to know how radial tires will affect the
        performance of a car originally fitted with bias-ply tires, and the
        considerations needed to compensate for the differences. Upgrading
        braking using either bespoke parts, parts produced by the vehicle's
        manufacturer, from later versions of the same model or later models that
        may be compatible with minor modification, is an effective method of
        improving safety. Popular examples include drum brake to disc brake
        conversions, or adding a vacuum servo to cars with front disc brakes
        that did not originally have one. Although they lack such advanced
        safety features as air bags, antilock braking systems, and other
        electronic controls, most US-market cars built 1966 and later have basic
        safety features such as padded dashboards, seat belts, dual-circuit
        braking systems, and safety glass. A few of the newest classic cars
        (1980s and 1990s) have more advanced safety features such as air bags,
        anti-lock brakes, and side-impact beams. NHTSA began their 35-mph full
        frontal crash test program in 1979, so these results are available for
        many post-1979 classic cars. Despite these concerns, classic cars are
        involved in significantly fewer accidents.

      <h2>Market values</h2>
      <h3><p>
        It is instructive to distinguish between valuation of classic car models
        and valuation of individual classic cars. For instance, two examples of
        exactly the same classic car model may have different market values
        depending on idiosyncratic factors such as mileage, service history,
        documentation, restoration quality, originality, participation to
        special events, distinctions and awards, and association with notable
        people. As regards valuation of different car models, it has been
        demonstrated that classic car model values are determined by observable
        characteristics pertaining to aesthetics, rarity, engineering and
        performance. In addition, classic car marques play a critical role in
        the determination of model values and account for considerable variation
        in values, even after controlling for observable classic car
        attributes.[38]
