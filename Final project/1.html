          <h1>10/10</h1>
          <br />
          <h2>1957 Mercedes 300SL Gullwing</h2>
          <p><h3>
          Before 1954, Mercedes was not selling the 300SL in America, and they were not going to start soon. It took the effort of one Mercedes lover and importer to get them to change their mind. When the 300SL Gullwing arrived in America, it was so pretty to behold, and the American population loved it.
          </h3></p>
          <br />
          <p><h3>
          The car was not just beautiful; it was built with the track in mind. Its racing heritage features included the space frame chassis and quite an impressive body design that featured an aerodynamic shape ready to pierce through the air on a racing track. The 215-horsepower engine was there to confirm what was outside.

          <h1>9/10</h1>
          <br />
          <h2>1960s Jaguar E-Type</h2>
          <p><h3>
          Enzo Ferrari referred to this car as the most beautiful car ever made, and sure it fits the description. If you are interested in only one sports car with the curves, the Jaguar E-Type is your perfect pick. This is a pretty classic sports car that you can drive today – it still has the vigor, and it breaks better than many cars of its era.
          </h3></p>
          <br />
          <p><h3>
          If you happen to be in the United Kingdom, you can visit the Jaguar Heritage Driving Experience in Kenilworth – at a small fee, you will drive this Jaguar E-Type classic. Then you can decide for yourself.

          <br />
          <h2>Aston Martin DB5</h2>
          <p><h3>
          If you love James Bond, then you know how pretty this ride is. It has appeared in many bond movies than any other car. And if it is beautiful enough for James Bond, then it’s pretty enough for us. The one used by Sean Connery in the 1964 Bond film, Goldfinger is the most astonishing of all DB5 classics.

            <h1>7/10</h1>
            <br />
            <h2>1953 Chevrolet Corvette</h2>
            <p><h3>
            The first-generation Corvette proved that America could produce a fast and curvy machine with the guts to compete with the best sports cars in the world. It put America on the map. It is astonishing in design and performance as well. The Corvette had fuel-injected engines that made the Corvettes extremely powerful and adorable.

          <h1>6/10</h1>
          <br />
          <h2>1956 BMW 507</h2>
          <p><h3>
            This less famous BMW roadster was produced between 1956 and 1959. BMW intended to export the 507 to the US in bulk, but the car was a little too expensive. It was worth the price. The BMW 507 featured brilliant aesthetics that could make anyone who cared less about the heft price make a buying decision.
          </h3></p>
          <br />
          <h3><p>
            Despite its beauty and power under the hood, this car never made any impact. There was only a total of 252 units produced, which resulted in significant losses for the company — however, it paved the way for the Z8.

          <div>
            <h1>5/10</h1>
            <br />
            <h2>1949 Rolls-Royce Dawn Drophead</h2>
            <p><h3>
              The 1949 Rolls-Royce Dawn Drophead had a minimal life span of only five years, which might be one reason why its beauty has never faded. Its design was based on the first car Rolls-Royce built after the war, and its name was supposed to announce Rolls-Royce place in the new dawn, or rather the modern era in the world.
            </h3></p>
            <br />
            <h3><p>
              Compared to the pre-war cars, the Dawn Drophead was big. And it re-introduced the motoring craftsmanship in the British auto manufacturing industry. The car did a perfect job bringing the Bespoke carmaker into the new automobile age. The Dawn Drophead is quite rare, and only 28 units were created. Three of these are still available in the United States.

          <h1>4/10</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>1955 Ford Thunderbird</h2>
        <p><h3>
          The 1955 Ford Thunderbird was a two-seat convertible that was built with the American beauty in mind. It was built upon the bespoke heritage of the 1930s and featured a 292cu, 4.8L, V8 engine.
        </h3></p>
        <br />
        <h3><p>
          Described by ford as “personal car of distinction,” the Thunderbird was built with the main focus on the driver comfort than speed. It was not a direct competitor to any sports car of the time, but it sure did stand out in beauty and comfort.

            <h1>3/10</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>1969 Toyota 2000G</h2>
        <p><h3>
          The Toyota 2000GT is a limited-edition front-engine sports car. It is a two-seat hardtop that was born as a result of Toyota – Yamaha collaboration. If you look at it and you see a Bond beauty, it is because Daniel Craig voted it as his favorite Bond car of all time.
        </h3></p>
        <br />
        <h3><p>
          The 1969 model was a little modified at the front, reducing the driving lights and modifying the turn signals. This is a stylish vehicle that comes with nothing short of an Italian hand-crafted sports car with a touch of beauty.

          <h1>2/10</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>1969 Dodge Charger</h2>
        <p><h3>
          If there is an American car that will never go out of fashion is the 1969 Dodge Charger. It has a fantastic fastback look and the American beauty all-round it. One outstanding feature is its aerodynamic body shape that is just as muscular. It may not get the billing that the Mustangs get, but the car is undoubtedly a figure of beauty.

            <h1>1/10</h1>
            <h2>1938 Bugatti Type 57 Atlantic</h2>
            <p><h3>
            Atlantic is a variant of Bugatti Type 57 that was produced from 1930 to 1940. The car is an exemplary work of art on an automobile. Today the Atlantic looks just as new, but with a price that perfectly matches its exquisite design. Type 57 used the same massive twin-cam 3257cc engine that Bugatti used on Type 49, but with a lot of modifications.
